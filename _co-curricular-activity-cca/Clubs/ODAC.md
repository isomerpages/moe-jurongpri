Outdoor Adventure Club (ODAC) was set up to promote awareness and appreciation of the outdoors. Our focus is in 3 main areas: outdoor education, environmental education, and the spirit of adventure. We aspire to carry out our focuses through playing, exploring and learning.        
  
ODAC will be organizing nature walks and treasure hunts in Jurong Lake area and possibly Bukit Timah Nature Reserve to allow students to appreciate nature and develop of a sense of belonging to our environment. Part of the curriculum will be risk assessment, planning and basic first aid.          
  
These outdoor activities aim to increase the child’s knowledge and awareness about the outdoor world and develop their skills to address challenges in a changing environment. We encourage students to develop attitudes to make informed decisions and take responsible action in the face of these challenges.     
Our focus is to use outdoor experience to foster the whole child’s willingness to try out new things and take calculated risks to appreciate the world around them. It is also to spur the sense of adventure in the child.
