# ECAL

As the school’s Learning for Life Programme, Every Child A Leader (ECAL) nurtures in students strong life habits and leadership skills.

We believe that every child can become an influential leader and make a difference to their community, Singapore and the world.

We aim to develop our children into:
* Self-confident individuals who seek continued self-improvement
* Effective communicators and team players
* Future-ready leaders who serve the community
