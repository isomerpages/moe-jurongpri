6 Traits of JPS Leaders
==============================

![](/images/JPSLeaders.jpg)

Strong leadership skills are indispensable to our children as they progress in life. Our LLP also brings JPS students through a curriculum which revolves around them learning key leadership traits, both theoretically in the classroom and hands-on as they take on roles and responsibilities throughout their JPS years.

Here, learning begins as early as in the Lower Primary years as students go through a 20-hour lesson series and subsequently work on their _Junior Leadership Challenge_.

Students further internalize these traits they take on leadership roles within the class and the school, and when they lead their class and schoolmates in programmes such as _Make a Change @ JPS_ .
