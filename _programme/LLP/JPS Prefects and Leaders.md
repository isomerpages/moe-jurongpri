Deserving Prefects and CCA Leaders are officially appointed during the annual Student Leaders’ Investiture. This affirms student leaders for their commitment, effort and school contributions and also highlights the importance JPS places on the grooming of its next echelon of leaders!

Every year, all prefects and CCA Leaders undergo leadership training sessions by an appointed vendor, learning skills such as active listening, conflict management and creativity. The Prefect EXCO also participates in a series of leadership conversations with School Leaders.

Putting their learning into practice, JPS prefects play active roles in the planning and execution of the school’s annual commemorative events such as Racial Harmony Day and National Day.


They also serve the school through roles such as assembly parade commander and recess I/Cs. These opportunities were invaluable in teaching them leadership skills such as responsibility, project management, problem solving and collaboration.
