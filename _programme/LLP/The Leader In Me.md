============================

**The Leader In Me (TLIM)**

Our LLP is anchored on _The Leader in Me_ (_TLIM_) – the children’s version of the more popularly-known [_7 Habits of Highly Effective People_](https://jurongpri.moe.edu.sg/qql/slot/u560/Programme/Every%20Child%20Is%20a%20Leader/7HabitsTree.pdf) by Stephen Covey.

All JPS students go through a thorough TLIM curriculum which teaches them simple but powerful life habits such as:

* Self-management
* Understanding and managing emotions
* Setting and achieving positive goals
* Working and playing well with others
* Feeling and showing empathy
* Establishing and maintaining positive relationships
* Self-improvement and self-care
* Self-reflection and positive routines
