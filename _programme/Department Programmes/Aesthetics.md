# Arts Week 
          
Arts Week 2022 was held from 19 – 26 September.  Through the theme ArtScape, the team aims to allow students time and space to explore their passions and interests in the arts, and to demonstrate the understanding of the relationship between visual arts and music.

We opened the week with celebration about the Arts – affirmation of the various SYF Performing Arts groups, as well as a video montage of what the arts mean to us as teachers and as students.  Recess activities included making use of the ‘Artivive’ application and guided by thinking routines ‘See-Think-Wonder’ and ‘Colours-Shapes-Lines’ to respond to augmented reality artworks.  We also created a collage for students to be part of a vibrant community of artists and musicians.

Within the classroom, students also created comic strips during the art lessons.  Thereafter, they added their own soundscapes in the music lessons, giving them the space to explore the relationship between visual arts and music.

The week ended on a high note with an assembly talk by Annette Lee, our homegrown filmmaker, actress and musician all rolled in one.  She shared about her passion in the arts and gave us many insights on doing what we love.
