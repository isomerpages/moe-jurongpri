Science 
==================

At JPS, our Science Department is committed to providing students with dynamic, engaging, and exploratory experiences to jumpstart their passion for learning. The Science Alive program and the Urban Farming and Indoor Greening Program work collaboratively to create a holistic and inspiring science education at JPS, fostering a passion for learning that extends far beyond the confines of the classroom.

Science Alive is designed to unleash the joy of learning in science and cultivate essential 21st Century Competencies. This initiative empowers students to delve into hands-on learning experiences, where they not only apply scientific concepts but also develop crucial skills such as planning, data analysis, and creative problem-solving. For example, P3 students designed and constructed boats to test their understanding of materials, promoting creative thinking and enjoyment of scientific exploration. Through these activities, students actively apply science process skills, fostering a deep understanding of the subject and, most importantly, an enjoyment of the learning process.

Our Urban Farming and Indoor Greening Program provides students with a distinctive opportunity to explore the intricate relationships between science, sustainability, and their local environment. Students actively engage in constructing terrariums and participate in the hands-on cultivation of vegetables and mushrooms. Through these activities, students not only gain practical knowledge but also valuable insights into the principles of food sustainability and the benefits associated with greening their immediate surroundings. This experiential learning approach fosters a deeper understanding of the connections between science and the environment, empowering students to become stewards of sustainability in their community.

We firmly believe that integrating these initiatives into our science curriculum enhances the educational experience for our students and empowers them to become environmentally conscious and scientifically literate individuals.

Join us on this exciting journey of discovery and growth!
