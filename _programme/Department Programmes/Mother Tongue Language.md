Mother Tongue Language 
======================

### Mother Tongue Language Month&nbsp;
-----------------------------

MTL Month is an annual event where competitions and activities of varying and engaging nature are organized for our MTL classes across the 6 levels, in the hope of developing our students’ confidence in using their MTL in their daily lives, and most importantly, nurturing their passion for lifelong learning.
 
The MTL Month has given our students an excellent opportunity to display their confidence in using their MTL in front of their peers and teachers.  Besides the winners who emerged from these competitions, all our students who had participated various activities also gained valuable experiences. 


<i>With continued hard work, we are confident that our students can shine brighter in their use of their MTL and find JOY in learning!</i>
