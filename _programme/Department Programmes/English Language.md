### ORACY@JPS
---------

Speaking well is a powerful tool one can use for learning. Effective speakers are empowered to better express themselves and also to be understood better.  They gain the ability understand those around them and gain social mobility. Speaking well will give our students a voice and will help them carve for themselves a place in society.

At JPS, we have a robust oracy programme put in place to help students learn through talk and to talk. Our 6-year program is planned, designed, modelled and scaffolded to enable our students to master the skills required of them to talk effectively. The explicit and systematic teaching of oracy across the levels follows closely to the skills outlined in our EL syllabus 2020.

From Primary 1, our students are taught how to articulate ideas, use both verbal and non-verbal cues to communicate with others, deliver presentations effectively and persuasively and engage with the audience.

Besides the oracy programme, our students are taken through STELLAR 2.0 which is an interactive literacy programme that fosters confidence in learning English using children’s literature. Our teachers use drama, visible thinking and differentiated learning to bring Joy to the EL classrooms. A week is set aside each year to Celebrate English Learning. Students come dressed in their favourite characters and engage themselves in literacy activities throughout the week.
