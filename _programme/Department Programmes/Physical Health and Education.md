**Swimsafer**

The school organised a SwimSafer programme for all Primary 5 students as part of the MOE - SportSG Co-Funding Scheme. As part of the Physical Education curriculum, the programme aims to allow the students to gain confidence, develop independence in the water and learn general and deep-end water safety.

For students who do not know how to swim, they were introduced to water skills such as forward and backward movement, entering and exiting the pool safely and introduction to personal water survival skills. Those who already have swimming qualifications were assessed by the coaches based on their competencies and placed in other progressive swimming stages. Half of the cohort had their training at the Bukit Batok Swimming Complex while the others had theirs at the Clementi Swimming Complex.

**P5 Adventure Camp 2022**

The P5 Adventure Camp this year was held at Jalan Bahtera Outdoor Adventure Learning Centre (JBOALC) from 19 Sep to 21 Sep 2022.

It has been two years since we have had a camp, therefore this year’s camp was a special one. It was smiles all around as we embarked on the outdoor learning journey.

At the end of the camp, the students will be able to work communally and collaboratively to solve problems. They also gained confidence through outdoor education experiences. They also built rapport and displayed team spirit among pupils and teachers of the class.

While playing team and initiative games, specific activities are designed and crafted, to give the students the opportunity to shed their shells, to be themselves and to get to know each other better. In the sub-division of their very own individual teams. they continue to build team cohesiveness through the establishment of a team identity, a flag symbol, and a team cheer. The fun and regale is further enhanced with the many cheers and chants that get created along the way by the team, egged on and inspired by their very own team facilitator.

During navigation, students learnt how to draw and read a map. They also had to find items hidden around camp, using the map.

This activity will involve Navigation and Orienteering.

In Low Elements, naturally the students are required to work together as a team. As one they must think, strategise, execute, and trust each another to continually find the solutions to ever increasing challenges. This low element circuit is sure to stretch them in their physical, emotional, and metal tenacity.

The P5s also did outdoor cooking. Armed with simple and standard supplies, the students will need to prepare meals, according to a certain recipe. Even though the complexity of the recipes differs, the student will be faced with a rather foreign task — to cook their own food. The edibility of the food will depend on the students' resourcefulness and how well the students work together in their pairs.

Leaning how to pitch tent. Students worked in groups to set up a tent. Though tent pitching they were able to learn life skills like communication and learning from mistakes.

The highlight of the camp was Campfire Night in which students were encourage to take part in performing with the team. The process of coming together with different ideas and practices to result in a good team performance was an enriching experience for the participants.

During first aid, students learnt to recognise an emergency situation, identify, assess and minimise immediate hazards to self and others. The learnt how to seek assistance from emergency services, display respectful behaviour towards casualty and accurately convey incident details to emergency services.

We ended the camp with a beach clean-up and  picnic at West Coast Park.
