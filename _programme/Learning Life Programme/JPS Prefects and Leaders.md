JPS student leaders are chosen through a rigorous selection process. These include panel evaluations, interviews with School Leaders, and even a rally and election exercise for the Head Prefect post! <br>
Prefects and CCA leaders are formally appointed at the annual Student Leaders’ Investiture, acknowledging their unwavering commitment, diligence and contribution to the school.

Every year, all prefects and CCA Leaders undergo leadership training sessions by an appointed vendor, learning skills such as active listening, conflict management and creativity. The Prefect EXCO also participates in a series of leadership conversations with School Leaders.

Putting their learning into practice, JPS prefects play active roles in the planning and execution of the school’s annual commemorative events such as Racial Harmony Day and National Day.


They also serve the school through roles such as assembly parade commander and recess I/Cs. These opportunities were invaluable in teaching them leadership skills such as responsibility, project management, problem solving and collaboration.
