PLAY@JPS
========================================================
**Overview**

PLAY@JPS (**P**assion, **L**earning, **A**dapt &amp; Apply, asking wh**Y**) is our Applied Learning Programme (ALP), where we seek to develop our students to become future-ready learners by developing their 21st-century competencies and fostering innovation through a play-based pedagogy. In an ever-changing world with new challenges and opportunities, we hope that our students will:

(i)	Harness adaptive thinking skills to fuel a curiosity that drives continual exploration and discovery.

(ii)	Develop and leverage their roles as confident communicators and collaborative creators to discerningly navigate challenges with creative and innovative solutions.

(iii)	Act as empathetic contributors and digitally empowered learners to responsibly employ technology in devising sustainable solutions for our environment and the wider global community.

**USP-Experience**

We adopt a play-based pedagogy and believe that children learn best when they are actively engaged in playful experiences. Play-based learning also enhances children’s capacity for innovative thinking and problem-solving.

Over the course of six years, our students will encounter various opportunities for play within our distinctive USP experience.
