·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; find learning fun and enjoyable

·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; stay curious and explore alternatives

·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; innovate with purpose and care

**USP-Experience**

We adopt a Play-based Pedagogy and believe that play can be purposeful and generate wonder and delight. Through play, we help them develop teamwork and collaborate with others, an important 21st century competency. We also can hear our students’ individual voices and allow them to make choices as well as give them time to reflect on their learning.

Across the six years, our students will experience different types of play that are age-appropriate:

Students with deeper interest or aptitude will be given the opportunity to explore a stretch curriculum.
