Character and Citizenship Education (CCE)
==========


At Jurong Primary School, Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) plays an important role in helping us to achieve our school mission to nurture all-rounded pupils of grace, distinction and sound moral values. In light of an ever-changing world, we hope that our students will be anchored in values and develop strong social-emotional competencies, ready to face whatever comes their way.

**Overview**

CCE 2021 is a refreshed Character and Citizenship Education experience for our students and we are committed to a school-wide implementation of CCE in the following areas:<br>
●        Character Development <br>
●        Citizenship Education and Social Studies <br>
●        Guidance Modules (Education and Career Guidance / Cyber Wellness / Sexuality Education) <br>
●        Values in Action <br>

Guided by a focus on student-centricity, we purposefully plan a cohesive learning experience for our students, aligning our efforts with the four goals of CCE 2021.

**1. Good Character Good Character** <br>
JPS students should have a sound moral compass and a strong sense of right and wrong. We would like them to think critically and ethically, be discerning in judgment, take responsibility for choices and actions, be caring towards others and strive for excellence;

**2. Resilience and Social-Emotional Well-Being**<br>
We want to educate our students to have a balanced sense of self, form and enjoy healthy relationships, be resilient when faced with challenges, find meaning in life, and have a sense of gratitude and appreciation;

**3. Future Readiness** <br>
In alignment with our school vision of preparing our students as future ready learners, we helped our students to have a sense of purpose in life, develop the dispositions of adaptability and lifelong
learning so as to be able to navigate education and career pathways purposefully and take on the challenges of the future, including the world of work and life; and

**4. Active Citizenship** <br>
Through the curriculum and student development experience, we develop in our students a strong national identity based on a sense of belonging to the nation, a sense of hope in themselves and the future, an awareness of the reality of Singapore’s vulnerabilities and constraints, and the will to act on improving the lives of others and building a future for our nation.

In addition, the Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) Department oversees programmes and activities that provide opportunities for our students to develop their social-emotional competencies and be rooted in our school core values of **Passion**, **Care**, **Responsibility, Integrity** and **Respect**.
