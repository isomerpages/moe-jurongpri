Character and Citizenship Education (CCE)
==========


At Jurong Primary School, Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) plays an important role in helping us to achieve our school mission to nurture all-rounded pupils of grace, distinction and sound moral values. In light of an ever-changing world, we hope that our students will be anchored in values and develop strong social-emotional competencies, ready to face whatever comes their way.

**Overview:**

The Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) Department oversees programmes and activities that provide opportunities for our students to develop their social-emotional competencies and be rooted in our school core values of **Passion**, **Care**, **Responsibility, Integrity** and **Respect**.

CCE 2021 is a refreshed Character and Citizenship Education experience for our students and we are committed to a school-wide implementation of CCE such as in the following areas:

●        Character Development

●        Citizenship Education and Social Studies

●        Guidance Modules (Education and Career Guidance / Cyber Wellness / Sexuality Education)

●        Values in Action
