# Values in Action

The Values in Action programme serves to involve students in meaningful activities that give them the opportunity to demonstrate core values and at the same time, contribute to their class, school and the community. We remind students that each and everyone of them has the ability to make a difference, tying in with the school’s leadership development programme, Make a Change @ JPS, where they initiate projects to benefit those around them. 

Students also take part in community projects organised by the school such as Project Love, making an impact in the community around.
