**Guidance Modules (Education and Career Guidance / Cyber Wellness / Sexuality Education)**

*Education and Career Guidance (ECG)*

ECG in JPS is a career awareness programme that facilitates acquisition of attitudes, skills and knowledge. The intention to have this programme is to enable students to better understand themselves, explore viable education and career options and to develop plans to achieve career aspirations in later years.

On top of ECG-focused FTGP lessons, we organise other activities such as the secondary school fair for P6 students to get a better understanding of different options available for them after primary school.

_Cyber Wellness_

With the Internet and social media at our fingertips, it is important to equip our students with the skills to be safe and responsible users. Aside FTGP lessons on Cyber Wellness, we appoint class ICT (Information and Communication Technology) Leaders who are trained with cyber wellness knowledge, values and the latest Internet risks and threats from the ever-changing Internet landscape, to serve as advocate for Cyber Wellness issues for their peers. A Cyber Wellness Assembly is also organised to inform our students about these issues and help them maintain a positive presence in cyberspace.
