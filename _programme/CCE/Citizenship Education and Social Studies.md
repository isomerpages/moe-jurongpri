### Total Defence Day

15 February marks the day that Singapore fell to the Japanese in 1942 during World War II. The commemoration of this day serves as a reminder to Singaporeans of our collective responsibility to defend our nation, and that Singapore is defensible and is worth defending.

On 15 February 2022, Jurong Primary School commemorated Total Defence Day. It was the intention of theme of this year's commemoration, "Together, We Keep Singapore Strong”, to encourage students to play a greater role in Total Defence and to highlight the different ways they can contribute.

Students went through a series of learning activities both in their CCE lessons as well as on SLS prior to Total Defence Day, highlighting the pillars on Social and Digital Defence. This learning was further contextualised through an interactive presentation in the hall on the actual day. As part of the event, some of our teachers and School Leaders were interviewed on their recollections of their time in National Service.

Students were also tasked to demonstrate Social Defence in practice and “Care Forward” where they actively find ways to demonstrate graciousness towards their environment, family members, friends and even strangers.

Through this event, students acquired greater sensitivity to those around them and were more conscious of their actions and their respective impact on others. They were empowered to step forward and contribute, because they now know they can.

The International Friendship Day 2022 event was commemorated on the actual day on Friday, 8 April. In a shift in form from how the event was conducted in the last two years, the one this year saw the students and staff congregating in the school hall for the first time since the start of the pandemic in two separate batches for the assembly programme 
Adhering to this year’s theme ‘Singapore in Asia’, the organising committee hopes by recognising the importance of connectedness between our neighbouring countries, our youth can play an active role in fostering people-to-people ties, and thus celebrate the region’s diversity and vibrancy and promote the spirit of friendship and collaboration. 
Besides the assembly programme with interactive elements, students also had classroom discussions and written reflections on current affairs of the world as well as a post-video presentation quiz on specific ASEAN countries done online. For individual work, students were encouraged to submit a graphic presentation of Cambodia based on resources found in issue 2 of the Kindsville Times / A-Ok! magazine to complete their learning objectives from this event.



### Racial Harmony Day

JPS commemorated Racial Harmony Day on 21 July 2022 and this event was even more memorable as it was the first event to be held after the easing of SMM. It was heartening to see everyone gather in the school hall as one community to commemorate RHD. 

Singapore: Our Multicultural Mosaic was the theme for RHD 2022. The theme focuses on the appreciation of the diverse races and religions that make up our multicultural society, and which contribute to our shared sense of cohesion and harmony. It also reflects how each community, while having the space to express its own identity as part of Singapore society, also intertwines with others to depict the unique cultural diversity that characterizes Singapore life. 

Our staff and students greatly appreciated the opportunity to dress up in their vibrant ethnic outfits and it was indeed a colorful day! The RHD team put up an array of activities for all to enjoy and take part in. The students enjoyed watching their teachers put up graceful dances that depicted our various ethnic communities. And the highlight of the day was the chance to play during recess! Due to the pandemic and SMM, the students have not been able to play as they used to in previous commemorations. This year with the help of our PSG and teachers, they had a blast playing the different traditional games. The students also took part in various other activities. 

We firmly believe that through such activities, our students are able to get a greater sensing of the importance of racial harmony in Singapore and will their utmost to upkeep the cohesion and harmony of our nation.

Jurong Primary School commemorated National Day on 8 August 2022. After a lengthy hiatus, the school finally returned to the parade square to hold the Observance Ceremony with uniformed groups in full regalia and prefects leading the Recollections; their voices reverberating in the open space. 

The school then moved to the hall where they experienced a multimedia journey through Singapore's past, present and future in a narrative peppered with community songs both old and new. Mr Ong even led the entire school in a hearty rendition of Home. While entertaining, the programme also resonated with students through its message of hope, progress and togetherness, amply emphasizing this year's theme - ‘Stronger Together, Majulah!’ 

The National Day souvenir this year is a special JPS-designed gold medallion with our (soon-to-be-different) school building embossed on one side and the 2022 theme ‘Stronger Together, Majulah!’ on the other. The medallion will serve to remind us of our 73 good years of grooming gracious citizens in JPS; how far we've come and how far we can continue to go, together.

The National Education (NE) Show has been co-organized by MINDEF and MOE to instill a sense of pride and belonging in students and to bring across the significance of our National Day. Our P5 pupils attended the NE Show on Saturday, 9 July 2022. The NE show was part of our commemoration of Singapore’s 57th National Day. 

Through the NE Show, the pupils learnt to be a respectful supporter, a caring motivator and a responsible spectator. They also reflected and shared what they enjoyed and learned during the show. Many shared about the different segments of the show and were thankful to all that came together to make the show possible. Students also had the opportunity to further develop a sense of national identity as a citizen of the nation.
