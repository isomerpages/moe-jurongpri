### Activities / Training Description 
----------------------------------

Scouting is a global movement of self-education for young people. Scouting offers a wider range of skills, activities and services that simply cannot be found in any other single youth organisation. The Scout programme is centred around outdoors and adventure, global, citizenship, leadership, fitness, creativity, beliefs, and all-rounded character development. In addition, activities are based on the natural sense of fun and enthusiasm of their age group and thus the training is achieved largely through games, interaction in small groups and activities.   

 If you have a zest for learning, adventure and life, come join us! Wear an attractive uniform, work towards progress awards and proficiency badges. Join an extended family of close to 30 million boys and girls around the world!
