### Activities/ Training Descriptions
---------------------------------

Football is game that involves 11 players in each opposing team. However, in primary school tournaments, to ensure the students develop in accordance to their age level, the game has been simplified to 8 players in a team.

During the CCA sessions, students will acquire ball handling skills being applied to relevant contexts of the game. Focus will initially be on 4 or 5 per team, which will provide the transition for them to progress to the competitive 8 v 8 format, which is the format for the inter-school tournaments. By having small sided games, students will have more touches of the ball, accelerating their progress in their playing ability.
