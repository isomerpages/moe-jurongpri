### Activities / Training Description
---------------------------------

Our mission is to allow Girl Guides the opportunity to develop their heart, mind and body by participating in numerous unit and inter-unit activities which are fun and interactive. These activities provide a rich platform for the members to develop their individual skills and competencies as well as networking opportunities with other members from the Girl Guides fraternity. Through these activities, they will be able to hone their basic life skills and also to make new friends.               
  
Beyond these, through the leadership roles of a 1st I/C or Sixer, members will be tasked to lead in selected activities during the year.
