### Activities / Training Description
---------------------------------

Track and field is offered to students who display good potential in track and field events.     
  
We help students to develop their talents and pursue excellence in the various track and field events. We also aim to develop students as leaders who display innate discipline, determination and sportsmanship. Students who show commitment and perseverance will have the capacity and opportunity to further develop and display their talent at the inter-school and national levels.     
  
We believe that our progressive training programme, coupled with our emphasis on character building, will ensure that students take away valuable lessons that will stay with them in their journey towards and active and healthy lifestyle.
