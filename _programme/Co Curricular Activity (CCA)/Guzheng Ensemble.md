### Activities/Training Description
-------------------------------

The Guzheng, also known as a Chinese zither, is a Chinese plucked string instrument with a history of more than 2500 years. The modern Guzheng has 21 strings and is tuned in a major pentatonic scale. 

During the practice sessions, you will pick up basic plucking techniques from qualified instructors. As you progress, you will learn advanced techniques and move on to play various genres of music. As a performing arts ensemble, members also learn about team work and performance etiquette.
