Modular CCA (Primary 3)
=======================
![](/images/P3modularCCA01.jpg)

In Term 2, our P3 students are given a chance to participate in this programme. They are allowed to attend up to 8 CCA exposure sessions of their choice. 

This will help them to learn more about the CCAs they are interested in, which will in turn, facilitate their decision-making as to which CCA to sign up for in Term 3.Â  

Everyone always has fun attending the sessions, with each session lasting for 2 hours.
