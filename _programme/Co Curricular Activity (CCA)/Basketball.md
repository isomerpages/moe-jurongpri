### Activities / Training Description
---------------------------------

The Jurong Primary School Basketball Team strives to develop the thinking athlete who is a confident team player. Values like resilience, self-discipline and sportsmanship are strongly emphasized and expected to be displayed both on and off the court. 

Students are provided a platform to cultivate leadership, confidence, teamwork, and fair play through participation in competitions. Students will learn fundamental basketball skills, physical conditioning, and perseverance through various Basketball CCA activities. In the process, students develop a positive attitude towards an active and healthy lifestyle. 

Also, Basketball CCA promotes social bonding among students and strengthens friendships while they are engaged in fun activities during training. We believe that with the right attitude and a willingness to work hard, students will be able to achieve excellence.
