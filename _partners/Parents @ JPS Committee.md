=======================

Dear Parents, <br> 
Happy New Year! We are pleased to share with you the new JPS PSG 2025 exco members. As fellow parents, we look forward to partnering all of you to make JPS a joyful and caring community for our kids to thrive in. Looking forward to your support for the school and PSG initiatives! 

Here are the level chats I/cs - 

Pri 1: Wendy, En En, Dinghua<br>
Pri 2: Wendy, En En, Isty <br>
Pri 3: Wendy, Dinghua<br> 
Pri 4: Wendy, I Ting<br>
Pri 5: En En, Isty, Ruby<br>
Pri 6: Ruby, I Ting<br>

As we are all parent volunteers, the level chat i/cs will help to moderate the chats for inappropriate comments. We trust that all parents will use this community chat responsibly to crowd source and share parenting tips for our children's wellbeing. 

Please only join the level chats that your child(ren) is/are in and the JPS PSG volunteer chat groups to keep our JPS PSG community relevant, vibrant and safe.

 Pls do not share this chat with others who do not have children in JPS. 

Thank you and remember to get our children to sleep early tonight! 

Cheers! <br>
