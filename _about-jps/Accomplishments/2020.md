### The Little Red Dot is Our Home
------------------------------

As part of Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) 2020 Celebrations, 2 groups of P5 students participated in the Youth Station Project Original Songs. They submitted songs they wrote as a group and received consultation and advice through videos recorded and uploaded, and were able to continue to develop their passion in music making online. We are proud to congratulate them for their achievements. One of the groups has emerged as the Top 15, or Top 5 in the primary schools category. The song was showcased during the National Day Celebrations in JPS.

  
Led by Mrs Marilyn Furukawa, Ms Yvonne Zheng and Ms Gu Siyuan, The Little Red Dot is our Home is composed and performed by:

Rosetiaralina Binte Rosli (5 Care)  
Muhammad Akif Bin Hazmi (5 Care)  
Joel Chan Zi An (5 Care)
