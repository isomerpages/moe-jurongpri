Principal's Message
=======================

The year 2024 marks a momentous occasion for Jurong Primary School as we celebrate our 75th anniversary. Reflecting on our humble beginnings at Old Jurong Road in 1950, the progress we have made is truly heartening.&nbsp; Our journey, further enriched by the merger with Boon Lay Primary in 2006, reflects a path rich in development and transformation, blending the distinct characteristics of both schools to forge our unique and vibrant identity.&nbsp;  
  
In early 2023, we introduced the theme 'Joy in JPS', a concept that encapsulates our belief in the educational journey of every student and the pivotal role and experience of teachers at JPS.   Anchored in four fundamental aspects - the Joy of Learning, which encourages a world of curiosity and exploration; the Joy of Teaching, celebrating the dedication and innovation of our teachers and support staff; the Joy of Caring, creating a supportive and warm environment for all through strong inter-personal relationships; and the Joy of Leading, fostering leadership skills in both our students and teachers - these principles are at the heart of our school life, infusing every day with a zeal for learning, teaching, care, and guidance.&nbsp;

To our cherished community of students, alumni, parents, and local supporters, your engagement and support are invaluable.  Together, we strive to cultivate a generation of students who are not only gracious and passionate but also reflective and rooted in solid values. We warmly invite you to partner us at JPS as we endeavour towards a future that is both forward-looking and deeply rooted in our Jurong community.&nbsp;  
  
As we step into 2024, our spirits remain high with anticipation for what lies ahead for JPS. This year ushers in a new chapter for us, one in which we build upon the robust foundations laid by our respected predecessors Ms Constance Yip, Mrs Manokara S, and Mr Robin Ong.  Here, I invite our entire school family – students, alumni, parents, and supporters – to join us in this joyous celebration and contribute to the unfolding story of Joy in JPS.&nbsp;  
  
Yours in service.
