Dear alumni,

Feeling homesick and missing JPS? Wish to see your teachers again?

We want to get to know the older you as well!
                                     
We joyfully invite you back to JPS on Thursday 31 Aug, 10:50am to 12pm.
If you’re coming, please register your interest here so that your teachers are aware of your homecoming:
