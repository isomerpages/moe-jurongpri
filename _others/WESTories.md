# 2023 WE-STories Publications

Dear Parents, 

The WE-STOries publication profiles the strengths and distinctiveness of West Zone secondary schools in a narrative, guiding students towards choosing schools based on their interests and strengths. 

The 2023 Publication includes interactive map displaying schools in their geographical location, and clickable links to view schools' videos and artefacts that showcase each school's distinctiveness. 

Please share this with your child and discuss with them the suitable secondary schools they could consider.
