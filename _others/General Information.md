### School Transfer
---------------

  

Ad-hoc transfer exercises are conducted between schools throughout the year. The receiving school will produce a Letter of Acceptance to the Parent/ Guardian, to be submitted to the sending school for transfer of pupil's documents.

The Parent/ Guardian will contact the sending school via phone/ school email for the school to prepare the documents for transfer. An appointment will be made with the Parent/ Guardian to go to the sending school and collect the documents when ready.

The Ministry of Education also conducts an annual transfer exercise (STEPS) for Primary 1  pupils with change in address. These pupils will be transfered to the new school the following year. The exercise is usually conducted between October and November each year.
